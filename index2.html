      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an enthusiastic and highly driven Electronics and Computer Engineering student currently pursuing my studies at the
        Malawi University of Business and Applied Sciences (MUBAS). My academic journey is fueled by a profound passion for the 
        rapidly evolving fields of Artificial Intelligence and data analysis, complemented by a strong affinity for powerful 
        design tools such as Figma and MATLAB. I find immense satisfaction in bridging the gap between the technical and creative realms
        of engineering. This means I'm equally adept at delving into the intricacies of embedded systems and optimizing hardware performance 
        as I am at crafting intuitive frontend designs, exploring innovative user interfaces, and building robust analytic workflows.</p>
      
      <p></p>

      <p>My academic and personal journey has been profoundly shaped by an innate love for problem-solving and a persistent desire to 
      engineer impactful solutions that address real-world challenges. I thrive in collaborative environments, valuing the synergy that emerges
      when diverse minds unite. This collaborative spirit has been central to my experiences, exemplified by our team's successful development 
      of the award-winning MUBAS flag designâ€”a project that truly underscored the power of shared vision and collective creativity. That spirit 
      of teamwork, innovative thinking, and shared achievement continues to be a core driver of my motivation.
    
      When I seek a mental reset or a fresh perspective, I often gravitate towards design, particularly experimenting with web layout concepts
      in Figma. This creative outlet not only offers a refreshing break from technical problem-solving but also inspires new ideas, allowing me 
      to harmoniously balance the rigorous logic of coding with the artistry and empathy required for exceptional user experience.</p>
